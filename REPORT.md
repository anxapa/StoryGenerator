## Challenges I Faced
**Challenge 1: REST API**
Problem: REST API was hard to figure out to implement with the functionality I needed.

Solution: Simply used the API calls without needing to use the HTTP part of REST, but still implemented the REST principles.

Learned: REST is not only limited to HTTP protocols.

## Design Pattern Justifications
**Strategy Pattern:** Needed different AI behaviors (still in-progress)

**Singleton Pattern:** Needed global save and load handler object accross the differnet classes

## AI Usage (BE HONEST!)
Used provided Claude example in Canvas

Modified: Changed their GUI code to fit with my program. Changed their client-and-server code to fit with my program.

Verified: Tested with thorough manual testing.

## Time Spent: ~40 hours
