    "story": "Elara lived in a small village nestled at the foot of the Shattered Plains. The sky above was a constant, brooding gray, and the wind often carried the scent of dust and something ancient, something powerful. Today, the wind felt different. It whispered of change.\n\nShe was helping her mother mend fishing nets near the edge of the village when a rider, cloaked and hurried, galloped past. He was heading towards the Highprince\u2019s distant fortress, a place Elara had only ever seen as a dark smudge on the horizon. The rider\u2019s horse was lathered, and his face was grim.\n\nLater that evening, the village elder, an old woman named Lyra with eyes that held the wisdom of many seasons, gathered everyone in the communal hall. The air was thick with worry. Lyra\u2019s voice, though frail, was steady.\n\n\u201cA message has come from the Highprince,\u201d she announced, her gaze sweeping over the anxious faces. \u201cThe Everstorm is coming.\u201d\n\nA hush fell over the hall. The Everstorm. It was a legend, a tale told to scare children, a storm so powerful it could reshape the land and awaken things best left sleeping. Elara shivered, even though the hall was warm.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s just a story, isn\u2019t it?\u201d whispered Kael, the baker\u2019s son, his face pale.\n\nLyra shook her head slowly. \u201cThe rider brought proof. The sky in the north is changing. The highstorms are growing fiercer. This is not a story, my dears. This is a warning.\u201d\n\nThe villagers looked at each other, fear blooming in their eyes. They were simple folk, farmers and fishermen. What could they do against a storm that was said to be the wrath of the very world?\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to us?\u201d Elara asked, her voice small.\n\nLyra placed a hand on Elara\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe will do what we always do. We will face it together. We will secure our homes. We will share what we have. And we will hope.\u201d She paused, her eyes meeting Elara's. \"There are whispers, too, of those who can harness the Stormlight, of warriors who can stand against the wind and the darkness. We will look for signs. We will be ready.\"\n\nAs Elara walked home that night, the wind felt heavier, more purposeful. The stars, usually hidden by the ever-present clouds, seemed to glimmer with a faint, internal light. It was a strange, unsettling light, like a promise or a threat. Elara looked up at the dark sky, a knot of fear and a flicker of something else \u2013 a strange kind of wonder \u2013 in her chest. The Everstorm was coming, and her simple world was about to change, forever.\n"
