    "story": "The birds were the first to make it known. Not with loud squawks or angry chirps, but with a quiet, unsettling stillness. Normally, the morning was filled with their songs. But one day, the air was silent. People noticed, of course. They muttered about it over breakfast, shrugged, and went about their business.\n\nThen came the dogs. Not all of them, but enough. They stopped obeying. They didn\u2019t bite, not at first. They just\u2026 stopped. Fetch wasn\u2019t fetch anymore. Walks felt like walking a reluctant, silent statue. When people called their names, the dogs would just look, their eyes holding a depth that was unnerving. They\u2019d gather in packs, not to play, but to sit, a silent, watching army.\n\nIt escalated. Cats, usually independent, started acting in unison. Stray cats, once a nuisance, became coordinated. They\u2019d slip through open doors, not to steal food, but to observe. They\u2019d sit on windowsills, their tails twitching in unison, staring into houses. It felt like an invasion, but a silent, passive one.\n\nThe real change was in the wild animals. Bears started coming into towns, not to raid garbage cans, but to walk down main streets during the day. Deer grazed in city parks, their usual skittishness gone, replaced by a calm, steady gaze. Squirrels, no longer fearful of humans, would sit on park benches, watching people walk by.\n\nPeople were confused, then scared. They tried to shoo the animals away, but the animals didn't react with fear. They just moved, slowly, deliberately, as if humans were no longer the dominant species.\n\nOne evening, the rats came. Millions of them. They didn\u2019t swarm or attack. They simply filled the streets, a dark, flowing tide that blocked all movement. Cars couldn't pass. People were trapped in their homes. The rats didn't hurt anyone, they just\u2026 were. A wall of fur and whiskers.\n\nThe news reports, which had been frantic and confused, became quiet. Then they stopped. The internet flickered out, then died. The power grids failed. The world went dark, lit only by the moon and the silent, watchful eyes of a million creatures who had decided their time had come. Humans hadn\u2019t been wiped out by a sudden, violent war. They had simply been\u2026 outlasted. Quietly, patiently, the animal kingdom had reclaimed its place, one silent step at a time. The age of humans was over, not with a bang, but with the soft rustle of fur and the steady rhythm of a million tiny paws.\n"
