    "story": "The rain tapped a steady rhythm against the windowpane, a soft, sad song. Inside, the small living room felt even quieter. Marcy sat curled on the sofa, her shoulders slumped, a tear tracing a slow path down her cheek. Chelsea sat beside her, her presence a gentle warmth.\n\n\"Hey,\" Chelsea said softly, her voice a low murmur. She reached out and lightly touched Marcy's arm. Marcy flinched a little, then leaned into the touch.\n\n\"It's just... everything feels so hard right now,\" Marcy whispered, her voice thick. She pulled her knees closer to her chest.\n\nChelsea nodded. She didn't try to offer easy answers or tell Marcy it would be okay. She knew that sometimes, that's not what people need. \"I know,\" she said. \"It really does.\"\n\nMarcy sniffled. \"I tried so hard, you know? And it still didn't work out.\" Another tear fell, and this time, she didn't try to wipe it away.\n\n\"I see how hard you try, Marcy,\" Chelsea said, her gaze steady and kind. \"You always put your whole heart into things.\" She paused, choosing her words carefully. \"It's okay to feel sad when things don't go the way you hoped. It's a normal thing.\"\n\nMarcy looked up, her eyes red and glistening. \"But it feels like I'm always failing.\"\n\n\"You're not failing,\" Chelsea said, her voice firm but gentle. \"You're learning. And sometimes, learning is messy and it hurts.\" She scooted a little closer, her shoulder brushing against Marcy's. \"Remember that time you tried to bake that cake for my birthday, and it kind of fell apart in the middle?\"\n\nMarcy managed a tiny, watery smile. \"It looked more like a pile of crumbs.\"\n\n\"But you kept going,\" Chelsea reminded her. \"And we still ate it, and it was still delicious because you made it with love. And this is kind of like that. It's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's bad.\"\n\nMarcy wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. \"It just feels like such a big disappointment.\"\n\n\"It is a disappointment,\" Chelsea agreed. \"And it's okay to feel that. You can be sad and disappointed, and still be strong. You are strong, Marcy.\"\n\nShe didn't push Marcy to talk more. Instead, she just stayed there, a quiet, comforting presence. After a while, Marcy leaned her head onto Chelsea's shoulder. The rain outside continued its steady beat, but inside, the silence was filled with a different kind of peace, the quiet understanding of one friend offering solace to another. The weight on Marcy's shoulders felt a tiny bit lighter, just by having Chelsea there, not fixing anything, but simply holding space for her pain.\n"
