    "story": "STORY NAME: The Silent Man\n\nSzeth son of Vallano walked. That was all he did. He walked and he carried. His arms were strong, and his back was broad. He walked through bustling towns where people shouted and laughed. He walked through quiet forests where only birds sang. No matter the place, Szeth son of Vallano walked.\n\nHis clothes were plain, a simple grey tunic and trousers. His face was often hidden by the hood of his cloak, even on sunny days. He spoke little, and when he did, his voice was a low murmur, like wind through dry leaves. Most people hurried away when they saw him. They felt a chill, a strange feeling they couldn\u2019t explain.\n\nOne day, Szeth son of Vallano walked into a village preparing for a festival. Bright cloths hung between buildings, and the smell of baking bread filled the air. Children, their faces smudged with dirt and joy, chased a small dog through the square. Szeth son of Vallano paused at the edge of the crowd, a large sack slung over his shoulder. The sack looked heavy, full of\u2026 something.\n\nA small boy, bolder than the rest, stopped chasing the dog and stared at Szeth. His eyes were wide. He dropped a wooden toy horse. It rolled towards Szeth\u2019s feet. Szeth son of Vallano bent slowly, his movements deliberate. He picked up the toy. It was a simple thing, carved by hand.\n\nHe looked at the boy, and for the first time in a long time, his eyes met another\u2019s without a rush to look away. He held the toy out. The boy hesitated, then took it back, his hand brushing Szeth\u2019s. A flicker of surprise crossed the boy's face, as if he had touched something unexpectedly warm.\n\nSzeth son of Vallano nodded, a tiny inclination of his head. Then, he turned and continued his walk. The sack on his shoulder felt no lighter, and the weight of his purpose remained. But as he walked away from the sounds of the festival, he carried a memory: the feel of a small, wooden horse, and the wide, unblinking stare of a child. He continued to walk, the silent man on his endless journey, carrying his unseen burden.\n"
